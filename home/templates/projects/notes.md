TODO:

Add a field to projects to denote if a scan has been run. This way on the overview page we can say as such.

This also means we can say no issues detected instead of a blank table lol

---

Change the sidebar so that the third nesting is gone, and projects just redirect you to the project overview page

---

Add a state for vulnerabilities as well as a notes field. These fields only show in the viewer, however can also be used as a filter within the overview page

---

Settings page:
Delete project
PATCH on primary fields
Run scan again
Delete all associated vulns

---

Website home page:
Create project, provide zip upload or git link
Overview for total projects, total vulns, vuln counts by type, etc

---

Vulns:
Have a field for scanner used and show within the viewer page

---

Move scans to background tasks after the request gets executed

---

Have the file as shown to the user be relative to the uploaded folder, not the path its downloaded to disk
